# Cooperativa Edificatrice Cernuschese
Build files for the "Cooperativa Edificatrice Cernuschese" [website](http://lunik.it), substantially a Python script which
generates a single page website, configurable editing the `config.py` file.

The website is automatically deployed by [netlify](https://www.netlify.com) at every commit, however
is possible to manually build it executing the `edifcernusco.py` script.  Note that the script requires the
environment variable `GMAPS_KEY` set, the actual value is set inside the control panel of netlify.
